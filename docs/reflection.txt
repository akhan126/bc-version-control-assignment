Reflection – Step 9 Analysis

For Step 9, I conducted a simple exploratory data analysis using a Jupyter notebook.
The notebook is saved at:

notebooks/step9_analysis.ipynb

In the analysis, I loaded the processed dataset from:
data/processed/dataset.csv

I computed basic summary statistics by calculating the mean of all numeric columns.
This step was intentionally simple and focused on practicing how processed data
flows into downstream analysis using the Cookiecutter Data Science project structure.

This demonstrates how cleaned and versioned data can be reused for reproducible
analysis.
